# ★ What is a code kata?
A code kata is a smaller exercise in programming which helps programmers to improve their skills through practice and repetition.



# ★ Where is the description of the task?
You can find the task description inside the project folder of each project. 
The filename is called "Task.txt". 
Alternatively you have a list at the end of this file of all exercises.
By clicking them you will be forwarded to the corresponding task description.



# ★ About my solutions
Every single (coding-kata)project is a Maven project. 
The reason for this is that certain dependencies are needed to make testing with JUnit 5 possible. 
This means that each of my solutions was covered as far as possible with JUnit 5 tests.
